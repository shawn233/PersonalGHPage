# Introduction

We compress files into an archive, or extract from one, in the following scenarios:

- On PC, we free the storage by putting a set of files into an archive.
- On PC, we download from the Internet and get compressed files.
- On servers, we make the best of the network bandwidth, by reducing the transmission payload.
- On business cloud storage, we avoid paying for more storage by compressing files into an archive.
- Whenever we want to access files in an archive, an uncompression is indispensible.

This article focuses on the Linux platform, which is widely deployed on PC and servers as the operating system (OS). PC OS includes Ubuntu, CentOS, Redhat, etc. On servers, Linux as OS is almost prevailing, such as Colab, Amazon Cloud and Ali Cloud.
