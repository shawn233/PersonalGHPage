Suggestions to myself on writing posts.

- Try using bullet points to explain an idea.
- Always remember that copying official documents does nothing more than wasting time. The only thing to help memorizing is to read and then practice.

Data structures in standard library:

- [std::*vector*](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/) is an array that dynamically changes in size to fit with its elements.
