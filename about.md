I am a 3^rd^ year undergraduate student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](en.sjtu.edu.cn), expecting to graduate in July 2020.

I am broadly interested in **security and privacy** issues in computer science area, and my research has covered **computer network privacy** and **machine learning security**. I have spent one years working with Prof. [Haojin Zhu](https://nsec.sjtu.edu.cn/~hjzhu) on network privacy research.

I will apply to **Ph.D**. programs enrolled in 2020 Fall and I am especially interested in research opportunities in **cybersecurity** domain. My up-to-date **C.V.** is available [HERE](https://github.com/shawn233/shawn233.github.io/files/CV_Xinyu_Wang.pdf). Please feel free to contact me at wangxinyu500103@gmail.com.
